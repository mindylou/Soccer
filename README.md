# Soccer
### Final project for Intro to iOS Application Development (CUAppDev Training Course)

Soccer mimics the minigame of the same name on Facebook Messenger. Tap the ball to keep it in the air: the longer you tap, the more points you score!

The game stores your username and high score to a database hosted by Firebase, and displays the "Score to Beat" and the person who scored it in the top right corner. It updates in real time!
Additionally, the game remembers your last high score and locally stores it. 
This game was implemented using Swift 3 and XCode 8, with Firebase Cocoapods.

Future additions may include levels and improved ball physics.
